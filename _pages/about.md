Hi there! I'm a PhD student at Stanford University at the Institute for
Computational and Mathematical Engineering (ICME), advised by [Johan
Ugander](https://stanford.edu/~jugander/). I'm interested in applying tools from
statistics, machine learning, and network science to study *people* and the
systems we all participate in. My current research applies discrete choice
models in school choice to model and simulate household preferences, partnering
with the San Francisco Unified School District for data access, for the purpose
of simulation and policy evaluation. In the past, I've done work in
[recommender systems](https://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2018/report/22.pdf) and
[balanced graph partitioning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3394486.3403239).

<!-- I got my bachelors and masters from Penn State University in Engineering Science and Mechanics in 2016-17. I was advised by Francesco Costanzo and wrote my thesis on computational methods for bio-fluid mechanics. It received our departmental Dr. Fenlon Award for Outstanding Undergraduate thesis. -->

I'm also very good at [ultimate frisbee](http://furyultimate.com/), earning
World and National titles in 2018 and 2021, am always listening to music, and
drink a cup of chai (almost) everyday.
