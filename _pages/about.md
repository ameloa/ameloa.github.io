I'm a Research Scientist at Meta on the Central Applied Science team, working on
GenAI for labeling efforts; utilizing large language models (LLMs) to label
content at scale across ads and organic content, for use in downstream
monetization and personalization tasks.


I'm also a PhD graduate in Computational Math from Stanford University, advised
by [Johan Ugander](https://stanford.edu/~jugander/). There, my research developed
discrete choice models to model household preferences for school choice, in
partnership with the San Francisco Unified School District, for the purpose
of inference and policy evaluation. In the past, I've done work in
[recommender systems](https://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2018/report/22.pdf) and
[balanced graph partitioning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3394486.3403239).


I'm also very good at [ultimate frisbee](http://furyultimate.com/), earning
World and National titles in 2018 and 2021, am always listening to music, and
drink a cup of homemade chai (almost) everyday. Welcome to my website!
